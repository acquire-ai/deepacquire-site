      <p>We were founded in 2025.</p>
      <p>
        Our original dream was this: now that we have super‑intelligent AI, how can people quickly gain and integrate
        AI’s intelligence?
      </p>
      <p>
        To call on AI’s intelligence as naturally as we use our own minds—or to enable our minds to rapidly gain AI‑like
        capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Guided by this vision, we built our first product, <span class="font-semibold text-accent"
          >Acquire Language</span
        >. It uses AI to accelerate how people acquire multiple languages.
      </p>
      <p>This is just the beginning…</p>
